# Book Quest 

### About
The "Book Quest" project aims to streamline and enhance the process of book discovery for users by leveraging the capabilities of popular NoSQL database **MongoDB's Full-Text Search**. It focuses on developing an efficient book searching web application. The core objective is to improve search efficiency, query complexity, and response speed, ensuring relevant results for the users.

In this project, we deep dive into the capabilities of MongoDB's Full Text Search and how it fares against popular SQL database **PostgreSQL** by comparing the effiency of query execution and the complexity of query searches supported by both.

âœ¨ Keywords  :SQL, NoSQL, Full Text Search, query optimisation
